# Singletons

Purpose of Singleton in iOS Development
In iOS development, singletons are commonly used to manage shared resources, such as:
1. Configuration Management: A singleton can hold application-wide settings that need to be accessed from different parts of the app.
2. Networking: A singleton can manage a single instance of a network manager that handles API calls and sessions, ensuring efficient use of resources.
3. Data Persistence: For example, a shared instance of a database manager can facilitate access to the database across different view controllers.
4. State Management: A singleton can keep track of the app’s state, such as user session details or app configurations.
5. Notification Center: When you need a centralized system for managing notifications across different parts of your application.Example: A NotificationManager singleton can handle broadcasting and observing notifications, ensuring that all components are notified of events in a unified manner.

How to create Singleton classes?
Static Property: static let shared holds the single instance of the class.
Private Initializer: private init() prevents the creation of additional instances.
Accessing the Singleton: You can access the singleton instance using MySingleton.shared throughout your application.


Disadvantages
* Global State: Can lead to tightly coupled code, making it harder to test.
* Concurrency Issues: If not handled properly, singletons can introduce thread safety issues, especially in multi-threaded environments.


Advantages
1. Global Access
* Easy Access: A singleton provides a global point of access to its instance, allowing any part of the application to use it without needing to pass references around. This can simplify code and make it easier to access shared functionality.
2. Shared Resources
* Resource Management: By having a single instance, you can efficiently manage shared resources, such as network connections, databases, or configuration settings. This helps to avoid resource duplication, which can lead to wasted memory and performance issues.
3. Consistent State Management
* Centralized State: A singleton can maintain a consistent state across different parts of the application. For example, a user session manager can keep track of user information and login status, ensuring all components have access to the same data.
4. Simplified Lifecycle Management
* Controlled Lifecycle: With a singleton, the lifecycle of the instance can be easily managed. It exists for the duration of the application, simplifying cleanup and initialization, as there’s no need to manage multiple instances.
5. Thread Safety
* Synchronized Access: When implemented correctly, a singleton can provide thread-safe access to shared resources. This is particularly important in multi-threaded environments, where concurrent access to shared data can lead to race conditions.
6. Reduced Memory Usage
* Single Instance: Since only one instance of the singleton exists, memory usage can be more efficient compared to having multiple instances of the same class.
7. Easy to Implement
* Simple Design: Implementing a singleton is straightforward and doesn’t require complex architecture, making it easy to adopt in various projects.
8. Testing Convenience
* Mocking and Testing: While there are some challenges (e.g., global state can complicate unit testing), singletons can be replaced with mock instances during tests, allowing for controlled testing environments.
9. Decoupling
* Separation of Concerns: By using a singleton to manage certain behaviors (like logging or configuration), you can decouple those responsibilities from other parts of your application, promoting cleaner code architecture.




Eager Singleton
* Definition: An eager singleton is instantiated at the time of the application's startup or when the class is loaded. The singleton instance is created immediately, regardless of whether it is actually needed.
* Initialization Timing: The instance is created as soon as the class is referenced for the first time, which means it occupies memory even if it may not be used throughout the application lifecycle.
* Resource Management: Since the instance is created upfront, it can lead to higher initial memory usage and resource consumption. This is particularly relevant if the singleton holds significant resources or performs expensive initializations.

Lazy Singleton
* Definition: A lazy singleton, on the other hand, is instantiated only when it is first accessed. The instance is created on-demand, which can help optimize resource usage.
* Initialization Timing: The instance is created only when a specific method or property that accesses it is called for the first time. This delays resource allocation until it is truly necessary.
* Resource Management: By initializing the singleton only when needed, lazy singletons can reduce initial memory usage and avoid unnecessary resource consumption, especially if the instance may never be used in certain execution paths.
